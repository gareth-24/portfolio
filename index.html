      <h2 class="card-title">About Me</h2>
      <p class="card-text">I am a former Civil EIT in the process of switching to a career in tech and web development. During my first year working as a civil design engineer, I was unsure if this was the field that I wanted to dedicate my life to. During the Covid-19 pandemic, I began using my new free time to pursue other options and interests. Luckily, I discovered the immense amount of resources that are accessible to learn coding. After speaking with some friends in the industry, I decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp to advance my technical skills. At Epicodus, I will learn to use HTML, JavaScript, C# and React, as well as how to effectively pair program. </p>
      <p>Outside of work and the classroom, I am an avid pacific northwest sports fan as well as a video game nerd. I enjoy traveling, barhopping with friends, lifting weights, attending UW football and Mariners games, and hopping on Discord to relax and play co-op games on weekends. </p>
